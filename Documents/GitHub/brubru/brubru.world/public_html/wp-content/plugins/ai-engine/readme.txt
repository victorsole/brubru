AI meets WordPress. Your site can now chat, write poetry, solve problems, and maybe make you coffee.

== Description ==
AI Engine seamlessly connects WordPress with the world's leading AI models. Create intelligent chatbots, generate content, build AI forms, and automate tasks—all from your WordPress dashboard.

You can create a chatbot to assist your visitors, answer support questions, or guide users through your products and services. Need fresh content? AI Engine can write posts in your voice, help rewrite existing ones, or translate them naturally into other languages. It can also generate custom images for your articles, refine messy text, or just lend a hand when you’re stuck.

For developers and power users, AI Engine offers internal APIs, shortcode flexibility, and advanced features like function calling and real-time audio chat. You can build your own AI-powered tools, automate tasks, or even create AI-driven SaaS applications on top of WordPress. And with support for a wide range of providers—OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, and more—you have full control over the models you want to use.

Everything is designed to feel native to WordPress. Whether you're exploring ideas in the AI Playground, using Copilot to help in the editor, or letting an AI agent manage your content through MCP, AI Engine is built to grow with you—and shaped by real user feedback every step of the way.

Please make sure you read the [disclaimer](https://meowapps.com/ai-engine/disclaimer/). For more tutorial and information, check the official website: [AI Engine](https://meowapps.com/ai-engine/). Thank you!

== Features ==

* **Model Management**: Bring the latest AI models (GPT-5, GPT 4.1, Claude, Gemini, o3, o4, 4o, and more) to WordPress. Set your preferred models to match your specific workflows. GPT-5 includes advanced reasoning and verbosity controls.
* **Chatbots**: Create interactive chatbots with customizable themes, avatars, conversation flows and realtime. Features a modular UI Builder with containers, headers, footers, and MacOS-style components.
* **AI Forms**: Build AI-driven forms that handle text, images, audio, or file uploads. Create custom AI-powered apps and online services with MCP server integration.

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Allow powerful AI agents (like Claude) to fully control and manage your WordPress site. Automate posts, content updates, manage media, and seamlessly integrate advanced AI workflows. AI Engine can also connect to external MCP servers, expanding your AI's capabilities beyond WordPress.
* **Cross-Site Embedding**: Embed your chatbots on external websites with domain-based access control and simple JavaScript integration.
* **AI-Powered Search**: Three intelligent methods—Simple WordPress search, Context-Aware progressive keyword search, and Smart Search using semantic embeddings.

* **Extensive Integration**: Seamlessly works with Media File Renamer, SEO Engine, Social Engine, Code Engine, and other WordPress plugins to power advanced AI features site-wide.
* **Flexible Theming & Shortcodes**: Control the look and behavior of your AI integrations using pre-built themes or your own custom CSS. Place chatbots or AI-driven forms anywhere using simple shortcodes.

Please note that some features require a Pro license (AI Forms, Embeddings, Usage Control, Realtime Chatbot). For more information, check the [official website](https://meowapps.com/ai-engine/).

== MCP (Model Context Protocol) ==

While WordPress core may one day add MCP support, AI Engine is already there. We've built a smart wrapper around WordPress's Core API that turns your site into an intelligent MCP server.

This means AI agents like Claude and ChatGPT can connect directly to your WordPress site and actually understand how it works. They can browse your content, edit articles, check SEO, manage your media files, and handle complex tasks without getting confused or lost like they do with regular APIs.

The best part? Other plugins can easily add their own features to this MCP system. [SEO Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-engine/), [Social Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-engine/), and [Code Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-engine/) are already connecting (or will be soon), so AI agents can manage your entire WordPress site just like a skilled human would.

AI Engine also works the other way around—it can connect to external MCP servers, giving your AI access to tools and services beyond WordPress. This means your chatbots and AI assistants can tap into a growing ecosystem of MCP-enabled applications and APIs.

== Beyond the Features ==

Since AI Engine has its own internal APIs, this allows you and others to integrate AI features to your WordPress. It has been officially integrated with many plugins to enhance their functionality. Here are a few examples:

* [Media File Renamer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/media-file-renamer/)
* [SEO Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-engine/)
* [Social Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-engine/)
* [Code Engine](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-engine/)

== My Dream for AI ==

I am thrilled about the endless opportunities that AI brings. But, at the same time, I can't help but hope for a world where AI is used for good, and not just to dominate the web with generated content. My dream is to see AI being utilized to enhance our productivity, empower new voices to be heard (because let's be real, not everyone is a native speaker or may have challenges when it comes to writing), and help us save time on tedious tasks so we can spend more precious moments with our loved ones and the world around us.

I will always advocate this, and I hope you do too 💕

= Why am I getting “Error 429: You exceeded your current quota”? =

This means your OpenAI API key has reached its limit or has no billing enabled. Check your [OpenAI billing settings](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing).

= The chatbot doesn’t show responses until I refresh the page. What’s wrong? =

This may be caused by a caching plugin. Try excluding the chatbot container or relevant pages from caching.

This is usually a REST API permission issue. Make sure you’re logged in and that your roles and tokens are set up correctly.

= Does AI Engine conflict with other plugins? =

Some plugins like caching tools (SiteGround Optimizer, WP Fastest Cache), TranslatePress, or The Events Calendar may interfere. Check plugin settings or disable specific features if needed.

Sometimes updates introduce temporary compatibility issues. Make sure you’re using the latest version of AI Engine and clear your browser cache.

= Why isn’t my image generation working with Azure/OpenAI? =

Check that your API key has permissions for image generation, and that the model and endpoint are correctly set. See documentation for more.
